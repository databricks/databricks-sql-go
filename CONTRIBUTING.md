# Contributing Guide

We happily welcome contributions to this package. We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sql-go/issues) to track community reported issues and [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sql-go/pulls) for accepting changes.

Contributions are licensed on a license-in/license-out basis.

## Communication

Before starting work on a major feature, please reach out to us via GitHub, Slack, email, etc. We will make sure no one else is already working on it and ask you to open a GitHub issue.
A "major feature" is defined as any change that is > 100 LOC altered (not including tests), or changes any user-facing behavior.
We will use the GitHub issue to discuss the feature and come to agreement.
This is to prevent your time being wasted, as well as ours.
The GitHub review process for major features is also important so that organizations with commit access can come to agreement on design.
If it is appropriate to write a design document, the document must be hosted either in the GitHub tracking issue, or linked to from the issue and hosted in a world-readable location.
Specifically, if the goal is to add a new extension, please read the extension policy.
Small patches and bug fixes don't need prior communication.

## Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from developercertificate.org):

```

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified

```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```

```

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
